# MindTrace Mental Health App

## Overview

MindTrace is a comprehensive mental health tracking application that helps users monitor their thoughts, emotions, and cognitive patterns. The app provides tools for tracking mental health data, analyzing patterns, and exporting insights for personal reflection or sharing with healthcare providers.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with in-memory storage
- **Authentication**: Simple username/password authentication
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses

### Mobile Architecture
- **Framework**: Capacitor for cross-platform mobile deployment
- **Target Platforms**: iOS (App Store) and Android (Google Play Store)
- **Build System**: Vite with mobile-specific configuration

## Key Components

### Data Models
- **Users**: Email-based authentication with password storage
- **Thoughts**: Mental health entries with content, emotions, intensity ratings, cognitive distortions, and triggers
- **Cognitive Distortions**: Predefined categories like "all-or-nothing thinking," "overgeneralization," etc.

### Core Features
1. **Thought Tracking**: Users can log thoughts with emotional intensity ratings (1-10 scale)
2. **Cognitive Analysis**: Categorization of thoughts using established cognitive distortion patterns
3. **Data Visualization**: Charts showing emotional patterns, frequency analysis, and trend tracking
4. **Export Functionality**: CSV export for personal records or healthcare provider sharing
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface with bottom navigation

### Authentication System
- Session-based authentication using Express sessions
- Email validation for usernames
- Password storage (note: currently plain text - should be hashed in production)
- Automatic session persistence across browser sessions

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration/Login**: Users authenticate via email/password → session established
2. **Thought Entry**: User inputs thought data → validated with Zod → stored in PostgreSQL
3. **Data Retrieval**: Frontend queries thoughts via React Query → filtered by date ranges
4. **Analysis**: Client-side processing of thought patterns → visualization with Recharts
5. **Export**: Server generates CSV → client downloads or shares data

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database operations
- **@radix-ui**: Accessible UI component primitives
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **recharts**: Data visualization components
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities

### Mobile Dependencies
- **@capacitor/core**: Cross-platform mobile runtime
- **@capacitor/ios**: iOS platform integration
- **@capacitor/android**: Android platform integration

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundling

## Deployment Strategy

### Web Deployment
- **Platform**: Replit with autoscale deployment
- **Build Process**: Vite builds client → ESBuild bundles server
- **Port Configuration**: Internal port 5000 → external port 80
- **Database**: PostgreSQL provisioned via Replit modules

### Mobile Deployment
- **iOS**: Capacitor → Xcode → App Store Connect
- **Android**: Capacitor → Android Studio → Google Play Console
- **Build Script**: Custom Node.js script for mobile-specific builds
- **Asset Management**: Optimized for mobile performance

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: tsx with hot reloading
- **Production**: Compiled JavaScript with NODE_ENV=production
- **Database**: Environment variable-based connection string
