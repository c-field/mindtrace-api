Please implement the following two critical fixes that are affecting user experience:
1. White Text on White Background Fix
Problem: Some text input boxes have white backgrounds with white text, making the text invisible/unreadable.
Required Fix:

Scan the entire codebase for ALL text input fields, text areas, and form elements
Identify any elements that have white or light backgrounds
Find all instances where text color is white (#FFFFFF, white, or similar) on white backgrounds
Implement a consistent dark grey text color for ALL white background input fields
Use the same dark grey color across all white background text boxes for consistency
Ensure proper contrast ratio for accessibility (text should be easily readable)

Implementation Steps:

Audit every form input, textarea, and text field in the app
Check computed styles to identify white-on-white text issues
Define a standard dark grey color (e.g., #333333, #2c2c2c, or similar)
Apply this color consistently to all white background text inputs
Test readability across all forms and pages

2. Page Load Scroll Position Reset
Problem: When navigating to a new page, it loads at the same scroll position as the previous page instead of starting at the top.
Required Fix:

Implement automatic scroll-to-top functionality for ALL page transitions
Ensure every new page loads with scroll position at (0,0)
This should work for:

Navigation menu clicks
Button-triggered page changes
Programmatic navigation
Browser back/forward navigation
Any other form of page transition



Implementation Steps:

Identify all navigation methods in the app
Add scroll reset functionality to route changes
Implement window.scrollTo(0, 0) or equivalent for each page load
Test with all existing routes and navigation patterns
Verify it works consistently across different browsers and devices

Testing Requirements:

Test every single form and input field in the app for text visibility
Navigate between ALL pages to verify scroll reset works universally
Check that fixes work in both Replit preview and when exported to native builds
Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
Verify consistent user experience across all app sections

Priority:
Both issues significantly impact user experience. The white text issue makes forms unusable, and the scroll position issue creates confusing navigation. Please implement these fixes immediately and test thoroughly.
