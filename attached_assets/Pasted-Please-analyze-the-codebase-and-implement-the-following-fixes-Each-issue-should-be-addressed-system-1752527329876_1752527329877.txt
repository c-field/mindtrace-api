Please analyze the codebase and implement the following fixes. Each issue should be addressed systematically with attention to cross-platform compatibility:
1. Confirmation Banner Z-Index Issue
Problem: Confirmation banners (login success, thought registration, etc.) appear behind/under the header instead of on top.
Required Fix:

Locate all confirmation/notification banner components
Ensure they have a higher z-index than the header component
Verify the banners appear above all other UI elements
Test that this works across different screen sizes

2. Page Navigation Scroll Position Reset
Problem: When navigating between pages, new pages load at the same scroll position as the previous page instead of starting at the top.
Required Fix:

Implement scroll-to-top functionality for all page transitions
Ensure this works for both programmatic navigation and user-initiated navigation
Test with all existing routes in the app
Verify smooth scrolling behavior

3. Export Page Date Input Text Color Inconsistency
Problem: The text color in the "from date" and "to date" input boxes on the export page doesn't match the white text color used in other input boxes throughout the app.
Required Fix:

Identify the current text color of date inputs on export page
Find the standard white text color used in other input boxes
Apply consistent styling to match the app's design system
Ensure proper contrast and accessibility

4. Intensity Level Dial Alignment Issue
Problem: The intensity level dial component works in Replit but fails in Xcode and TestFlight. The dial doesn't align properly with number 5 and other numerical indicators.
Required Fix:

Debug why the dial works in Replit but not in native iOS builds
Check for any web-specific CSS or JavaScript that might not translate to native
Ensure the dial component aligns precisely with all numerical markers (1-10 scale)
Test specifically that number 5 alignment is perfect
Verify the component works identically across all platforms

5. Header Logo Padding Adjustment
Problem: The logo in the header has insufficient padding underneath, making it appear too close to the bottom edge of the grey header.
Required Fix:

Locate the header component and logo styling
Increase the bottom padding/margin under the logo
Ensure the adjustment maintains visual balance with other header elements
Test across different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior

Implementation Notes:

Test all fixes on both the Replit environment and when exported to Xcode/TestFlight
Maintain existing functionality while implementing these fixes
Ensure changes don't break existing styling or layout
Pay special attention to cross-platform compatibility issues
Verify all changes work across different device sizes and orientations

Please implement these fixes one by one and test each thoroughly before moving to the next.
