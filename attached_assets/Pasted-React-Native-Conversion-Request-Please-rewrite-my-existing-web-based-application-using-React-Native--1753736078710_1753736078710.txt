React Native Conversion Request
Please rewrite my existing web-based application using React Native to create a truly native mobile experience. Here's what I need:
Current App Structure
My app currently uses:

Frontend: React 18 with JavaScript/JSX and TypeScript/TSX components
Backend: Node.js + Express with TypeScript
Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
Mobile: Capacitor wrapper for iOS/Android deployment
Key Components: Track.jsx, Analyze.jsx, Profile.jsx, slider.tsx, carousel.tsx

Conversion Requirements
1. Frontend Migration to React Native

Convert all React web components (Track.jsx, Analyze.jsx, Profile.jsx) to React Native equivalents
Transform TypeScript UI components (slider.tsx, carousel.tsx) to use React Native components
Replace web-specific elements with React Native components:

<div> → <View>
<span>, <p> → <Text>
CSS styling → StyleSheet or styled-components
Web forms → React Native form components


Implement React Native navigation (React Navigation) instead of web routing
Ensure responsive design works across different mobile screen sizes

2. Backend Considerations

Keep the existing Node.js + Express TypeScript backend as-is (it should work with React Native)
Ensure API endpoints are properly configured for mobile app consumption
Update CORS settings if needed for React Native client
Maintain PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM setup

3. Mobile-Specific Features

Implement proper React Native navigation structure
Add native mobile UI patterns and components
Ensure proper handling of:

Touch gestures and interactions
Mobile-specific layouts
Status bar and safe area handling
Keyboard avoiding views where needed



4. Development Setup

Set up React Native CLI or Expo development environment
Configure proper build settings for iOS and Android
Set up debugging and development tools
Ensure hot reloading works properly

5. Dependencies and Libraries

Identify React Native equivalents for any web-specific libraries
Set up necessary React Native packages for:

HTTP requests (axios or fetch)
State management (if using Redux/Context)
Navigation (React Navigation)
UI components and styling
Any specific functionality from the original app



Key Deliverables

Complete React Native project structure
All components converted from React web to React Native
Proper navigation implementation
Mobile-optimized styling and layouts
Working connection to existing backend API
Build configuration for iOS and Android
Updated package.json with React Native dependencies

Preserve Functionality
Please ensure all existing features and functionality from the original app are maintained in the React Native version. The app should work seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices while providing a native mobile experience.
Note: Focus on creating a true native mobile app experience rather than a web wrapper, taking advantage of React Native's native components and mobile-specific capabilities.
