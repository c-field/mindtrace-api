# Fix React Native Project Structure

I need you to fix the React Native project you created. The current `react-native-app/` directory is missing the proper React Native project structure - specifically the `ios/` folder, `Podfile`, and other essential configuration files needed for iOS development.

## Current Problem
- The `react-native-app/` folder only contains the converted components but lacks the native project structure
- Missing `ios/` directory with Xcode project files
- Missing `Podfile` for iOS dependency management
- Missing essential React Native configuration files

## What I Need You To Do

### 1. Properly Initialize React Native Project
```bash
# Delete the current incomplete react-native-app directory
rm -rf react-native-app/

# Create a proper React Native project with TypeScript template
npx react-native@latest init MindTrace --template react-native-template-typescript

# Rename it to react-native-app for consistency
mv MindTrace react-native-app
```

### 2. Restore the Converted Components
After creating the proper project structure, move all the converted screens and components back into the new project:

- Copy all the converted screens from the previous `src/screens/` to the new project
- Copy any custom components and services you created
- Update the navigation structure in the new `App.tsx`
- Install all the React Native dependencies we discussed earlier

### 3. Essential Files That Must Be Present
Ensure the new project has:
- `ios/` directory with `.xcworkspace` and `.xcodeproj` files
- `ios/Podfile` for CocoaPods dependency management
- `android/` directory for Android builds
- Proper `package.json` with all React Native dependencies
- `babel.config.js`, `metro.config.js` configuration files
- `App.tsx` as the main entry point

### 4. Update Dependencies
Make sure to install all the React Native packages we need:
```json
{
  "@react-navigation/native": "^6.x.x",
  "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^6.x.x",
  "@react-navigation/stack": "^6.x.x",
  "react-native-screens": "^3.x.x",
  "react-native-safe-area-context": "^4.x.x",
  "react-native-gesture-handler": "^2.x.x",
  "react-native-vector-icons": "^10.x.x",
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.x.x",
  "react-native-chart-kit": "^6.x.x"
}
```

### 5. Configure the Main App Component
Update `App.tsx` to include the navigation structure and screens you previously converted, making sure it properly integrates with React Navigation.

## Expected Result
After this fix, I should have:
- A complete React Native project that can be opened in Xcode
- All the converted mental health app screens properly integrated
- Proper iOS and Android build configurations
- The ability to run `cd ios && pod install && cd ..` successfully
- The ability to open the project with `open ios/*.xcworkspace`

This will create a production-ready React Native project that maintains all the component conversions you did while having the proper native project structure for iOS and Android development.
